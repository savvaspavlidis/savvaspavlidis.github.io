# Some help for GithubPages noobs!

I am no computer illiterate. But when I started to create my blog here, I felt like one. The reason? All how-to's and tutorials
where written either for the complete naive, or the expert in Jekyll and Markdown.. I wasnot either of them. I wanted to use
Jekyll and the themes provided for a nice blog, but whithout the fuss of a local setup, blogging directly via web if possible. I have already used Jekyll in the past to create my 
[site](http://www.pavlid.is/myprojects/index.html), but wanted something simpler for now. I thought that this could be handled by Github and to be concentrated only to my posting pages!
<p>
It wasn't so.
<p>
Upon creating my "website" according to how-to's, a README was displayed. No tutorials what to do next, and all I could find, 
was how to make a local clone repository and setup Jekyll. I made a _posts directory, and created some documents, but nothing
happened. I even contacted Github support, but perhaps something was lost in the translation, because surely I haven't made them
understand my problem. I was lost. I even considered to continue to my old site after all, were I was in complete control.
<p>
Then finally in one site, it mentioned to create an index.html file. I was struck like a noob. OK, done that. Still I could not
publish posts. Then I thought that it may be usefull to make an index.html file like the one used in my original site. And so
the posting showed up. This is the second one! Now I must refresh my markdown and start using it.
<p>
Final point to anyone would like to use Github pages. Find another site to your liking, that uses Github pages, and see their
settings and scripts and code, and use the parts to your likings. After all, they are public anyway! You can copy/clone mine too.
